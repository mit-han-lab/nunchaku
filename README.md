## Overview

![teaser](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/nunchaku-artifacts/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/teaser.jpg)
SVDQuant is a post-training quantization technique for 4-bit weights and activations that well maintains visual fidelity. On 12B FLUX.1-dev, it achieves 3.6Ã— memory reduction compared to the BF16 model. By eliminating CPU offloading, it offers 8.7Ã— speedup over the 16-bit model when on a 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, 3Ã— faster than the NF4 W4A16 baseline. On PixArt-âˆ‘, it demonstrates significantly superior visual quality over other W4A4 or even W4A8 baselines. "E2E" means the end-to-end latency including the text encoder and VAE decoder.

## Method

#### Quantization Method -- SVDQuant

![intuition](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/nunchaku-artifacts/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/intuition.gif)Overview of SVDQuant. Stage1: Originally, both the activation $\boldsymbol{X}$ and weights $\boldsymbol{W}$ contain outliers, making 4-bit quantization challenging.  Stage 2: We migrate the outliers from activations to weights, resulting in the updated activation $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}$ and weights $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$. While $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}$ becomes easier to quantize, $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$ now becomes more difficult. Stage 3: SVDQuant further decomposes $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$ into a low-rank component $\boldsymbol{L}_1\boldsymbol{L}_2$ and a residual $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}-\boldsymbol{L}_1\boldsymbol{L}_2$ with SVD. Thus, the quantization difficulty is alleviated by the low-rank branch, which runs at 16-bit precision.

#### Nunchaku Engine Design

![engine](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/nunchaku-artifacts/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/engine.jpg) (a) NaÃ¯vely running low-rank branch with rank 32 will introduce 57% latency overhead due to extra read of 16-bit inputs in *Down Projection* and extra write of 16-bit outputs in *Up Projection*. Nunchaku optimizes this overhead with kernel fusion. (b) *Down Projection* and *Quantize* kernels use the same input, while *Up Projection* and *4-Bit Compute* kernels share the same output. To reduce data movement overhead, we fuse the first two and the latter two kernels together.


## Performance

![efficiency](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/nunchaku-artifacts/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/efficiency.jpg)SVDQuant reduces the 12B FLUX.1 model size by 3.6Ã— and cuts the 16-bit model's memory usage by 3.5Ã—. With Nunchaku, our INT4 model runs 3.0Ã— faster than the NF4 W4A16 baseline on both desktop and laptop NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs. Notably, on the laptop 4090, it achieves a total 10.1Ã— speedup by eliminating CPU offloading. Our NVFP4 model is also 3.1Ã— faster than both BF16 and NF4 on the RTX 5090 GPU.

## Installation
We provide tutorial videos to help you install and use Nunchaku on Windows, available in both [**English**](https://youtu.be/YHAVe-oM7U8?si=cM9zaby_aEHiFXk0) and [**Chinese**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BTocYjEk5/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=8926212fef622f25cc95380515ac74ee). You can also follow the corresponding step-by-step text guide at [`docs/setup_windows.md`](docs/setup_windows.md). If you run into issues, these resources are a good place to start.

### Wheels

#### Prerequisites
Before installation, ensure you have [PyTorch>=2.5](https://pytorch.org/) installed. For example, you can use the following command to install PyTorch 2.6:

```shell
pip install torch==2.6 torchvision==0.21 torchaudio==2.6
```

#### Install nunchaku
Once PyTorch is installed, you can directly install `nunchaku` from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/nunchaku/tree/main), [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/Lmxyy1999/nunchaku) or [GitHub release](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku/releases). Be sure to select the appropriate wheel for your Python and PyTorch version. For example, for Python 3.11 and PyTorch 2.6:

```shell
pip install https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/nunchaku/resolve/main/nunchaku-0.2.0+torch2.6-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl
```

##### For ComfyUI Users

If you're using the **ComfyUI portable package**, make sure to install `nunchaku` into the correct Python environment bundled with ComfyUI. To find the right Python path, launch ComfyUI and check the log output. You'll see something like this in the first several lines:

```text
** Python executable: G:\ComfyuI\python\python.exe
```

Use that Python executable to install `nunchaku`:

```shell
"G:\ComfyUI\python\python.exe" -m pip install <your-wheel-file>.whl
```

**Example:** Installing for Python 3.11 and PyTorch 2.6:

```shell
"G:\ComfyUI\python\python.exe" -m pip install https://github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku/releases/download/v0.2.0/nunchaku-0.2.0+torch2.6-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl
```

##### For Blackwell GPUs (50-series)

If you're using a Blackwell GPU (e.g., 50-series GPUs), install a wheel with PyTorch 2.7 and higher. Additionally, use **FP4 models** instead of INT4 models."

### Build from Source

**Note**:

*  Make sure your CUDA version is **at least 12.2 on Linux** and **at least 12.6 on Windows**. If you're using a Blackwell GPU (e.g., 50-series GPUs), CUDA **12.8 or higher is required**.

*  For Windows users, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku/issues/6) for the instruction. Please upgrade your MSVC compiler to the latest version.

*  We currently support only NVIDIA GPUs with architectures sm_75 (Turing: RTX 2080), sm_86 (Ampere: RTX 3090, A6000), sm_89 (Ada: RTX 4090), and sm_80 (A100). See [this issue](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku/issues/1) for more details.


1. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   conda create -n nunchaku python=3.11
   conda activate nunchaku
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   pip install ninja wheel diffusers transformers accelerate sentencepiece protobuf huggingface_hub

   # For gradio demos
   pip install peft opencv-python gradio spaces GPUtil
   ```

   To enable NVFP4 on Blackwell GPUs (e.g., 50-series GPUs), please install nightly PyTorch>=2.7 with CUDA>=12.8. The installation command can be:

   ```shell
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
   ```

2. Install `nunchaku` package:
    Make sure you have `gcc/g++>=11`. If you don't, you can install it via Conda on Linux:

    ```shell
    conda install -c conda-forge gxx=11 gcc=11
    ```

    For Windows users, you can download and install the latest [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&cid=2030&passive=false).

    Then build the package from source with

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku.git
    cd nunchaku
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    python setup.py develop
    ```

    If you are building wheels for distribution, use:

    ```shell
    NUNCHAKU_INSTALL_MODE=ALL NUNCHAKU_BUILD_WHEELS=1 python -m build --wheel --no-isolation
    ```

    Make sure to set the environment variable `NUNCHAKU_INSTALL_MODE` to `ALL`. Otherwise, the generated wheels will only work on GPUs with the same architecture as the build machine.

## Usage Example

In [examples](examples), we provide minimal scripts for running INT4 [FLUX.1](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux) and [SANA](https://github.com/NVlabs/Sana) models with Nunchaku. It shares the same APIs as [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and can be used in a similar way. For example, the [script](examples/flux.1-dev.py) for [FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) is as follows:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import FluxPipeline

from nunchaku import NunchakuFluxTransformer2dModel
from nunchaku.utils import get_precision

precision = get_precision()  # auto-detect your precision is 'int4' or 'fp4' based on your GPU
transformer = NunchakuFluxTransformer2dModel.from_pretrained(f"mit-han-lab/svdq-{precision}-flux.1-dev")
pipeline = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev", transformer=transformer, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
).to("cuda")
image = pipeline("A cat holding a sign that says hello world", num_inference_steps=50, guidance_scale=3.5).images[0]
image.save(f"flux.1-dev-{precision}.png")
```

**Note**: If you're using a **Turing GPU (e.g., NVIDIA 20-series)**, make sure to set `torch_dtype=torch.float16` and use our `nunchaku-fp16` attention module as below. A complete example is available in [`examples/flux.1-dev-turing.py`](examples/flux.1-dev-turing.py).

### FP16 Attention

In addition to FlashAttention-2, Nunchaku introduces a custom FP16 attention implementation that achieves up to **1.2Ã— faster performance** on NVIDIA 30-, 40-, and even 50-series GPUsâ€”without loss in precision. To enable it, simply use:

```python
transformer.set_attention_impl("nunchaku-fp16")
```

See [`examples/flux.1-dev-fp16attn.py`](examples/flux.1-dev-fp16attn.py) for a complete example.

### First-Block Cache

Nunchaku supports [First-Block Cache](https://github.com/chengzeyi/ParaAttention?tab=readme-ov-file#first-block-cache-our-dynamic-caching) to accelerate long-step denoising. Enable it easily with:

```python
apply_cache_on_pipe(pipeline, residual_diff_threshold=0.12)
```

You can tune the `residual_diff_threshold` to balance speed and quality: larger values yield faster inference at the cost of some quality. A recommended value is `0.12`, which provides up to **2Ã— speedup** for 50-step denoising and **1.4Ã— speedup** for 30-step denoising. See the full example in [`examples/flux.1-dev-cache.py`](examples/flux.1-dev-cache.py).

### CPU Offloading

To minimize GPU memory usage, Nunchaku supports CPU offloadingâ€”requiring as little as **4 GiB** of GPU memory. You can enable it by setting `offload=True` when initializing `NunchakuFluxTransformer2dModel`, and then calling:

```python
pipeline.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()
```

For a complete example, refer to [`examples/flux.1-dev-offload.py`](examples/flux.1-dev-offload.py).

## Customized LoRA

![lora](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/nunchaku-artifacts/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/lora.jpg)

[SVDQuant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05007) seamlessly integrates with off-the-shelf LoRAs without requiring requantization. You can simply use your LoRA with:

```python
transformer.update_lora_params(path_to_your_lora)
transformer.set_lora_strength(lora_strength)
```

`path_to_your_lora` can also be a remote HuggingFace path. In [`examples/flux.1-dev-lora.py`](examples/flux.1-dev-lora.py), we provide a minimal example script for running [Ghibsky](https://huggingface.co/aleksa-codes/flux-ghibsky-illustration) LoRA with SVDQuant's 4-bit FLUX.1-dev:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import FluxPipeline

from nunchaku import NunchakuFluxTransformer2dModel
from nunchaku.utils import get_precision

precision = get_precision()  # auto-detect your precision is 'int4' or 'fp4' based on your GPU
transformer = NunchakuFluxTransformer2dModel.from_pretrained(f"mit-han-lab/svdq-{precision}-flux.1-dev")
pipeline = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev", transformer=transformer, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
).to("cuda")

### LoRA Related Code ###
transformer.update_lora_params(
    "aleksa-codes/flux-ghibsky-illustration/lora.safetensors"
)  # Path to your LoRA safetensors, can also be a remote HuggingFace path
transformer.set_lora_strength(1)  # Your LoRA strength here
### End of LoRA Related Code ###

image = pipeline(
    "GHIBSKY style, cozy mountain cabin covered in snow, with smoke curling from the chimney and a warm, inviting light spilling through the windows",  # noqa: E501
    num_inference_steps=25,
    guidance_scale=3.5,
).images[0]
image.save(f"flux.1-dev-ghibsky-{precision}.png")
```

To compose multiple LoRAs, you can use `nunchaku.lora.flux.compose.compose_lora` to compose them. The usage is

```python
composed_lora = compose_lora(
    [
        ("PATH_OR_STATE_DICT_OF_LORA1", lora_strength1),
        ("PATH_OR_STATE_DICT_OF_LORA2", lora_strength2),
        # Add more LoRAs as needed
    ]
)  # set your lora strengths here when using composed lora
transformer.update_lora_params(composed_lora)
```

You can specify individual strengths for each LoRA in the list. For a complete example, refer to [`examples/flux.1-dev-multiple-lora.py`](examples/flux.1-dev-multiple-lora.py).

**For ComfyUI users, you can directly use our LoRA loader. The converted LoRA is deprecated. Please refer to [mit-han-lab/ComfyUI-nunchaku](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/ComfyUI-nunchaku) for more details.**

We thank MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, MIT and Amazon Science Hub, MIT AI Hardware Program, National Science Foundation, Packard Foundation, Dell, LG, Hyundai, and Samsung for supporting this research. We thank NVIDIA for donating the DGX server.

We use [img2img-turbo](https://github.com/GaParmar/img2img-turbo) to train the sketch-to-image LoRA. Our text-to-image and image-to-image UI is built upon [playground-v.25](https://huggingface.co/spaces/playgroundai/playground-v2.5/blob/main/app.py) and [img2img-turbo](https://github.com/GaParmar/img2img-turbo/blob/main/gradio_sketch2image.py), respectively. Our safety checker is borrowed from [hart](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/hart).

Nunchaku is also inspired by many open-source libraries, including (but not limited to) [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [QServe](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/qserve), [AWQ](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq), [FlashAttention-2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention), and [Atom](https://github.com/efeslab/Atom).
